    "Jupyter notebooks are a comprehensive way to write documentation, run snippets of code, and check output of code, all in an easy to read format. Snippetes are written in modules called ```cells```, and you can add and delete cells. The format of a notebook is often linear, from top to bottom; a developer expects you to run earlier cells before running current cells.\n",

    "There are two main types of cells in these notebooks: Markdown, and code. Markdown is a format to write bullets, headings, etc., similar to Google Docs. Code is by default Python 3 code (as you installed it in Conda); you can verify this by checking the top-right corner of this browser.\n",
